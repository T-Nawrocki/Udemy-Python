# Building on the code from the last exercise, this program stores the data for our Account class in a database

import sqlite3
import pytz
import datetime

db = sqlite3.connect("accounts.sqlite")
db.execute("CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS accounts (name TEXT PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL, balance INTEGER NOT NULL)")
db.execute("CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS history "
           "(time TIMESTAMP NOT NULL, account TEXT NOT NULL, amount INTEGER NOT NULL, PRIMARY KEY (time, account))")
# Note how the PRIMARY KEY is defined separately in this second command.
# This is called a "composite key", which means that no two records can have the same time AND the same account
# (although they can still have the same time OR the same account)

# Another thing to note is that including the balance in the accounts table breaks database Normalisation rules
# (remember that these are broadly speaking database style guides for producing easily maintainable/clean databases).
# In this case, the balance is unnecessarily dependent on the transactions tableâ€”we could remove the balance field
# entirely and replace it by summing the transactions in the transaction table. However, when your database gets
# much larger and has a very long transactions table, calculating the account balance this way every time you need
# it could cause performance issues. So you will often see examples like this where the usual rules for database
# normalisation are broken for the sake of improved performance. A real financial application might run an operation
# during quiet times to compare the values in the balance field with the transactions table, to keep them in line.

# The python sqlite3 library supports datetime values and will automatically convert data to datetime
# values when we read/write our timestamp values. However, we need to tell it to do that, which we will get to later.

# When converting a decimal number to binary, you look for the highest power
# of 2 smaller than the number and put a 1 in that column. You then take the
# remainder and repeat the process with the next highest power - putting a 1
# if it goes into the remainder and a zero otherwise. Keep repeating until you
# have dealt with all powers down to 2 ** 0 (i.e., 1).
#
# Write a program that requests a number from the keyboard, then prints out
# its binary representation.
#
# Obviously you could use a format string, but that is not allowed for this
# challenge.
#
# The program should cater for numbers up to 65535; i.e. (2 ** 16) - 1
#
# Hint: you will need integer division (//), and modulo (%) to get the remainder.
# You will also need ** to raise one number to the power of another:
# For example, 2 ** 8 raises 2 to the power 8.
#
# As an optional extra, avoid printing leading zeros.
#
# Once the program is working, modify it to print Octal rather than binary.

# print() is a FUNCTION, which takes an ARGUMENT
# the argument can be a literal, or something else like an arithmetic expression
# LITERAL = a value (eg a string literal, a numeric literal, etc)
# functions can take more than one argument (see line 11)
# functions are CALLED when you use them and give them arguments

print("Hello, World!")
print(1 + 2)
print(7 * 6)
print()
print("The End", "or is it?", 1 / 5)  # note space separators are added in output

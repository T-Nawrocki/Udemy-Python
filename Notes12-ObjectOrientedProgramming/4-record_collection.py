# A docstring is a "documentation string". It is a type of comment used to describe what a class/function does, not how.
# Aim to be concise in your documentationâ€”don't compromise on information, but avoid taking unnecessary space.

# Docstrings are used by the help() function and the .__doc__ attribute, among other things, as documentation which
# can be pulled directly from your class or function
